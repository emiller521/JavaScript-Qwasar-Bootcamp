QWASAR'S MY-MOVING-BOX-REALTIME CONSIST OF:

Complete an index.html file with the missing javascript code in order to move the "div" with the id my_box_realtime to the coordinate of: bottom:

	LEFT 0 and RIGHT 0 MOVING THE BOX MUST BE SMOOTH. 

It means you will update the position slowly:

	YOU CAN ONLY CHANGE THE POSITION (vertically and horizontally) OF ONE POINT EVERY 0.5 SECONDS.

YOU CAN NOT CHANGE THE VALUE OF HTML, MOVING THE BOX MUST BE DONE IN JAVASCRIPT.

  	<html>
        	<div id="my_box_realtime" style= "background-color: red; position: absolute; right: 70; bottom: 70; min-width: 100px; min-height: 100px"></div>
        	<script type="text/javascript">
           	**YOUR CODE**
        	</script>
  	</html>
