Create an index.html file with this content:

	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
    	<body>
    	</body>
    	<script>
		index = 0;

		while (XX) {
			console.log("I want to code");
			XX // <- you should increment
		}
		</script>
	</html>


Implement a while loop to print 100 times "I want to code". (Don't forget to increment the index ;-))

Replace/Complete the following code. (XX is what you need to replace)
