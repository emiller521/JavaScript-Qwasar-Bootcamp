Another concept is abstraction and how to do this? A short answer is with functions.

What is a function? A function is a body of code that returns a value. The value returned may depend on arguments provided to the function.

Let's talk about our assignment:

Create an index.html file with this content:

	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
    		<body>
    		</body>
    		<script>
      			// function will print with console.log("my_first_function")
      			XXXXXX
      			XXXXXX
      			XXXXXX

      			my_first_function();
    		</script>
	</html>

Replace the XX by the necessary code to create a function called my_first_function.
