A function is a ****FLOW****, with an input and an output. In the middle it's doing something.

Let's talk about our assignment:

Create an index.html file with this content:

	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
    		<body>
    		</body>
    		<script>
      		// function will console.log("detonation in... "+seconds_left+" secondes.")

		timer = 10;

		while (XX) {
			detonation_in(timer);
			XX
		}
		</script>
	</html>

Function accepts parameters, let's send an integer to our function and print it!

Implemente a while loop to call a function detonation in...X secondes. Your loop will stop a 0. 10 included, 0 is not. (Don't forget to decrement the index ;-))

Replace/Complete the following code. (XX is what you need to replace)

To display your page you will need a ****Static HTML Page Renderer****
