We continue our journey with function. We talked about input (parameters).

Let's talk about the output. (return)

Let's talk about our assignment:

Create an index.html file with this content:

	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
    		<body>
    		</body>
    		<script>
      			// function my_get_seven() will return 7

			console.log(my_get_seven());
		</script>
	</html>


Function returns a value, let's print it!
