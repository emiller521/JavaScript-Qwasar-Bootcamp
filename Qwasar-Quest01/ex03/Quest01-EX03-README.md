First part of coding is to create variable. Let's get started with an integer variable. What does it mean "integer variable?"

In most languages different "types" are defined. ****What is a type?****

A good example is a letter is different from a number.

We will start with numbers.

And before starting to code, we will have to visit another notion: script tag. In html, Javascript code must be place inside script tag. You will see in the code below <script>, it's the only place where code are interpretated.

Enought talking!

****CREATE A VARIABLE NAMED: 'AGE' WITH THE VALUE OF 34.****

    age = xxxxxx;
    
****CREATE AN "index.html" FILE WITH THIS CONTENT:****

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <body>
        </body>
        <script>
          // Put your variable here
        </script>
    </html>
    
To display your page you will need a static html page renderer.
