I've seen variable can have different ****type****. Let's continue with another type: ****STRING****.

A string is a ****WORD****, it's just multiple characters. There are defined as an array but we will see this later on.

Same as before it will need to be inside a script tag.

Let's talk about our assignment:

Create an [****index.html****] file with this content:

	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
    		<body>
    		</body>
    		<script>
      			// Put your variable here
    		</script>
	</html>

Create a variable named ****MY_STRING**** initialized to the value ****"Learning is growing"****.

Notice the ****'****, this is where a string is different from an integer. Strings are surrounding by this ****'**** character.

To display your page you will need a static html page renderer
