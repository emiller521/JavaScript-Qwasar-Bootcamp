We've seen variable can have different ****type****. Let's continue with another type: ****character****.

Same as before it will need to be inside a ****SCRIPT**** tag.

Create an index.html file with this content:

	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
    		<body>
    		</body>
    		<script>
      			// Put your variable here
    		</script>
	</html>


Create a variable named ****letter**** initialized to the value ****'c'****. Notice the ****"'"*****, this is where a character is different from an integer. Letter are surrounding by this ****'****.

To display your page you will need a static html page renderer
